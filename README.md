# Food Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing food sales data using pivot tables and charts to derive insights and solve specific business problems. The dataset includes two tables: food sales and customer data, with a common identifier linking them. By leveraging pivot tables, pivot power tables, and pivot charts, various analyses are conducted to understand sales trends, popular products, customer behavior, and more.
